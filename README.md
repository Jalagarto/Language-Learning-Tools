# Language Tools

2 modules for the moment:

1. **Translator with GUI**:**
  - It translates from multiple languates
  - It uses google engine
  
2. **English_to_CSV**:
  - It creates a csv file with a list of words translated from English to Spanish.
  - The point of this is that while reading a book or an article, we can write words in a txt file.
  At the end of it we can generate a summary to be studied later.
  - This is less good looking, but more interesting for the student.
  
- Both Scripts work as executables on linux (to be done in windows is straight forward though).
Remember to chmod +x them and change the paths in the *.desktop* files.


TO DOES: 
  - make CSV list multilanguages.
  - change the CSV app to use goodle, since bing only allows a certain number of translations (Version2)
